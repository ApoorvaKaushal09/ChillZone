      <p>Begin the game by pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard. The ball will randomly
      move across the screen and players must control the paddles to defend their goals. A player
      wins by defending their goal and knocking the ball in the other player's goal.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is a two-player game. Player 1 controls the left paddle by using the "W" and "S" keys.
        Player 2 controls the right paddle by using the "Up" and "Down" arrows.
